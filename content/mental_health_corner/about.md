## DOCTORS 4 DOCTORS 

- Historically, doctors are not good at having their own GP, nor in seeking psychiatric help if needed. 
- In response to this need, DHASWA has compiled a list of doctors who have expressed an interest in doctors’ health and are willing to see doctor (and medical student) patients as a priority. 
- Currently, the list includes General Practitioners, Psychiatrists and Clinical Psychologists
