![About Cover Image](/images/About.jpg)

Curtin Association of Medical Students (CAMS) is the official representative body of medical students at Curtin Medical School. Established in 2017, CAMS is the newest medical students’ society in Western Australia, representing the State’s only undergraduate MBBS program. We engage regularly with our members and faculty staff to provide the best learning environment for our students. Furthermore, we are extensively involved with larger representative bodies, including the Australian Medical Association and Australian Medical Students’ Association.

Our students come from a range of metropolitan and rural backgrounds, from both WA and interstate. We pride ourselves on our welcoming and positive culture, encouraging participation and excellence in academia and extracurricular activities. We offer a wide range of events and opportunities for students, supported by our Academic, Sports, Social, Mental Health, IT, and Publications Representatives with the leadership of the Executive Committee.

CAMS expresses its gratitude to our sponsors who support our engagement with the students we represent. We hope to continue to work together with our sponsors to achieve our shared goals and values.
